Directory Navigation: The Linux filesystem consists of numerous directories containing files. You can navigate between these directories using the cd (change directory) command.
Using cd: To change directories, use cd followed by the path of the desired directory. For example: cd /some/new/directory
Current Working Directory: Each process, including your shell, has a "current working directory". The cd command changes this for the current process.
Prompt Information: The ~ symbol in your prompt typically represents your home directory. After changing directories, the prompt updates to show your new location.
Challenge Task: You need to run the /challenge/run program from a specific directory. The program will tell you which directory to use. You must cd to that directory before executing the program again.
