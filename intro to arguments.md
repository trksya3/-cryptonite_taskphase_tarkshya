n a shell, commands are followed by arguments that provide additional data. For example, in the command echo Hello, "echo" is the command, and "Hello" is the argument, which the shell processes and prints. Commands can accept multiple arguments, such as echo Hello Hackers!, which prints both words. 
The key concept is that the first word is always the command, and everything after that are arguments. 
To complete the challenge, run the hello command with the argument "hackers" by typing hello hackers into the terminal.
